# Sales Insights
This Repository contains the visualization I have created in Tableau for Atliq company.
## About
Atliq is a hardware company which have various branches at different regions (or) locations. Atliq company's overall sale is declining and to find out the reason behind it I have created a interactive dashboard to get some insights and take appropriate decision to improve the performance.

## Dataset
I have used the SQL database dump to build the dashboard. 

## Summary
In my tableau dashboard I have created a revenue trend chart to see the revenue generated in past to current years. There are two graphs which shows the Revenue generated by markets (Regions) and Sales Quantity by markets (Regions).
To get more insights I have added two more graphs which shows Top 5 product by revenue and Top 5 product by sales quantity. So if we select any one of the regions (markets) we can have proper understanding of its performance.
I have added timeline as well to see the performance year wise or month wise.

## Credits
I have learned and used the resources provided by [Codebasics][1].
